NAME
    goanysync - Directory symlinker and content syncer.

SYNOPSIS
    goanysync <command>

DESCRIPTION
    goanysync is a relatively small program to replace given directories in
    HDD/SSD with symlinks to tmpfs and then syncing tmpfs contents back to
    HDD/SSD.

COMMANDS
    sync	Backups given sync directories and moves their content to tmpfs
    replacing orginal directories with symlinks to the new location in the
    TMPFS.
    unsync	Removes symlinking and restores orginal state of the sync directories.
    check	Checks whether sync was called without calling unsync before used
    TMPFS was cleared (rebooting the computer can for example cause this).

MOTIVATION
    goanysync began as fork of anything-sync-daemon (by graysky), but is now
    basically a complete rewrite and only the documentation and functionality
    still bares resemblance to asd. Rewrote was mainly inspired by permission
    problems with symlinked dirs and by the original programs bash code which
    contained gems like this:
    [[ -d "$VOLATILE$i" ]] || mkdir -p "$VOLATILE$i" || "install -Dm755 $VOLATILE$i"

SETUP
    All settings are defined in goanysync.conf which by default is installed
    under /etc.

USAGE
    goanysync can be used directly or through wrapper script like "gsd" which is
    included in the package. "gsd" is Arch Linux rc script so it depends on
    the distributions initscripts. Basically wrapper script is used to run
    "goanysync check && goanysync sync" on system startup and "goanysync sync &&
    goanysync unsync" on shutdown or reboot.
