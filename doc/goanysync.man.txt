NAME
    goanysync - Directory symlinker and content syncer.

SYNOPSIS
    goanysync <command>

DESCRIPTION
    goanysync is a relatively small program to replace given directories in
    HDD/SSD with symlinks to tmpfs and to sync this tmpfs contents back to
    HDD/SSD.

    Two main use cases are reducing wear on SSD and speeding up programs by moving
    their data directories to tmpfs.

COMMANDS
    initsync	Replaces sync directories with symlinks to tmpfs while syncing
    orginal content there.
    sync	Syncs content from tmpfs to the backup.
    unsync	Removes symlinking and restores orginal state of the sync directories.
    check	Checks whether sync was called without calling unsync before used
    TMPFS was cleared.
    start	Alias for executing commands "check" and "initsync" in this order.
    stop	Alias for executing commands "sync" and "unsync" in this order.

SETUP
    All settings are defined in goanysync.conf which by default is installed
    under /etc.

USAGE
    goanysync can be used directly or in archlinux through included rc.d
    script. Basically this rc.d script just runs start/stop commands on system
    startup and shutdown.
