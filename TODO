TODO
====
- Cleanup deb package creation in Makefile:
    * Check package with lintian

- Test that build works on ubuntu 12.04
    * Is libtool package really needed?

- Check that really works with systemd.

- Make non-root user runnable, lock path to config file and permission check
    to runners uid and gid.
   * Add configuration option for the lock file dir.
   * Check how lockfile dir should be created for different distributions.
     * This should probably be package maintainers problem.

- Parameters for sync command to select what dirs to sync from the dirs
  specified in the config file.
    * With this change cron can be used selectively to sync some dirs.

- Fix various logging problems.
    * "kernel" prefix.
    * Multiline syslog messages.

- Configure should handle PKGBUILD files.

- Cache conf file values when "start" is called, so that conf file can be
  modified and it won't mess "stop". New conf file values would be used when
  next "start" is called.

MAYBE
-----
    - Wrap logger so that log target is run-time selectable.
    - Option for snapshot: backup backups to rotating .tar.xz files.
    - Some way to check tmpfs size?

NEVER
-----
    - Support for renice ionice cronjob, and maybe for general rsync.
        * Users can always edit cronjobs themselves.
