TODO for the next release
-------------------------

- getcwd() fails if current working directory doesn't exist, find a way to act
  sanely.

- More testing.

- Document info command (man) and make it clearer, it's more like debug tool
  now, not that useful.


General TODO
------------

- Refactor/clean code and move utility functions to utils package.

- Consider, would the config file caching still be needed.

- Log: Allow to set syslog priority to different value than console priority.

- TMPFS paths parent dir must exists at the moment.

- Cleanup deb package creation in Makefile:
    * Check package with lintian

- Test that build works on ubuntu 12.04
    * Is libtool package really needed?

- Check that really works with systemd.

- Parameters for sync command to select what dirs to sync from the dirs
  specified in the config file.
    * With this change cron can be used selectively to sync some dirs.

- Fix various logging problems.
    * "kernel" syslog prefix on Archlinux at least.

- script/goanysync.in should take bin path from autoconf.

- Run-time selectable log target.

- Option for snapshot: backup backups to rotating .tar.xz files.
