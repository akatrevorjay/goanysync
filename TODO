TODO
====

- Test that build works on ubuntu 12.04 and add ubuntu specific instructions.
    * Is libtool package really needed?

- If github continues to have bugs with asciidoc use rst or md.

- Check that really works with systemd.

- Make non-root user runnable, lock path to config file and permission check
    to runners uid and gid.
   * Add configuration option for the lock file dir.
   * Check how lockfile dir should be created for different distributions.
     * This should probably be package maintainers problem.

- Parameters for sync command to select what dirs to sync from the dirs
  specified in the config file.
    * With this change cron can be used selectively to sync some dirs.

- Fix archlinux specifity:
   * goanysync.service is archlinux specific.
- Add sdist PKGBUILD

- Fix various logging problems.
    * "kernel" prefix.
    * Multiline syslog messages.

    - Option for snapshot: backup backups to rotating .tar.xz files.
    - Some way to check tmpfs size?

NEVER
