TODO
====
- Document info command (man) and make it clearer, it's more like debug tool
  now, not that useful.

- TMPFS paths content is not deleted after stopping goanysync:
    - Good thing if something goes wrong, one place where data can still be
      found.
    - If a user doesn't have "enough" memory the TMPFS can fill up.
    - Possible partial solutions:
        -> One could always delete the data after stopping goanysync.
        -> Add a cmdline option for TMPFS path cleanup for unsync and stop options,
           or general option which removes all but currently synced data.
        -> Add a remainder how much space is used.

- Log: Allow to set syslog priority to different value than console priority.

- TMPFS paths parent dir must exists at the moment.

- Cleanup deb package creation in Makefile:
    * Check package with lintian

- Test that build works on ubuntu 12.04
    * Is libtool package really needed?

- Check that really works with systemd.

- Make non-root user runnable, lock path to config file and permission check
    to runners uid and gid.
   * Add configuration option for the lock file dir.
   * Check how lockfile dir should be created for different distributions.
     * This should probably be package maintainers problem.

- Parameters for sync command to select what dirs to sync from the dirs
  specified in the config file.
    * With this change cron can be used selectively to sync some dirs.

- Fix various logging problems.
    * "kernel" syslog prefix on Archlinux at least.

- Cache conf file values when "start" is called, so that conf file can be
  modified and it won't mess "stop". New conf file values would be used when
  next "start" is called.

- script/goanysync.in should take bin path from autoconf.

MAYBE
-----
    - Wrap logger so that log target is run-time selectable.
    - Option for snapshot: backup backups to rotating .tar.xz files.
    - Some way to check tmpfs size?

NEVER
-----
    - Support for renice ionice cronjob, and maybe for general rsync.
        * Users can always edit cronjobs themselves.
